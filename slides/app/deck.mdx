# What is Terraform?

---

# What is Terraform?

- Treat infrastructure just like applications
- Declarative syntax
- Can be version controlled, peer-reviewed
- Remembers the state of the world
- Applies the new desired state of the world
- Is multi-cloud
- Is more than cloud

---

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0d729a60"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

```terraform
provider "dominos" {
  first_name = "My"
  last_name = "Name"
  email_address = "my@name.com"
  phone_number = "15555555555"

  credit_card {
    ...
  }
}

resource "dominos_order" "order" {
  address_api_object = ""
  item_codes = [""]
  store_id = ""
}
```

# What Terraform is NOT

---

# What Terraform is NOT

- Replacement for config management
- An automation tool by itself
- Silver bullet multi-cloud
- Migration tool

---

# Setting the stage

---

## We know we can...

- Can run AWS commands locally
- Can run terraform locally
- Can open files with StreamDeck
- Combine the 3? YES

---

# How did we get here?

---

# How did we get here?

- Idea developed live on a Twitch Stream
- Idea evolved to a working proof of concept
- Eventually became containerized and portable
- And now we're showing it off!

# How this should work

We need a speedy volunteer...

# Simple Demo

Let's make a thing in the cloud!

---

<Image src='images/demo1.png' />

---

# A use case to think about

- Temporary, secure resources
- Offload processing
- Async processes, free up user's machine

---

---

# But, it can destroy what it creates

Anything tracked in Terraform state can be modified or destroyed.

Including things like local files and keys.

# Another Demo

---

# Another User case to think about

- Team meetings
- Project updates
- 'Save the date' info site
- Quick demo for client
- Fantasy Football Week Winners

# Destroy all the things!
